    <h2>Bitcoin and politics</h2>
    <p>
        I have been a member of the Bitcoin community for many years now. Often the question comes up if Bitcoin is political. And sometimes, people try to put Bitcoin into the right-wing corner.
    </p>

    <p class="img-subtxt">QAnon is an American far-right political movement.</p>

    <p>
        Bitcoin is a technology and is political just as much as the steam engine or the wheel. Of course, one can utilize technology to achieve particular aims, and these aims can be politically colored. People trying to put Bitcoin into a right-wing corner are missing that Bitcoin followers come from diverse political viewpoints regarding left vs. right.
        I find it very interesting how these generally opposing groups find some common ground as their aims can be surprisingly aligned semantically.<br/>
        A common theme in the left-wing community is, for instance, the negative stance against the Capitalistic world. Initially, somebody from the right would have a problem with this sentiment because their views are generally pro-capitalism. If you try to understand what Capitalism means for both parties, we see that the semantics are not fully aligned. Somebody on the liberal left side associates with Capitalism everything they consider wrong about our current system—for instance, the divide between the poor and rich resulting from privileges enjoyed only by the rich. See, for example, the Occupy Wall Street movement <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/occupy-wall-street-begins-zuccotti-park">[1]</a>.<br/>
        Now for the liberal right-wing person, Capitalism represents free markets, people peacefully working for each other, free from coercion. The privileges described beforehand are seen as a move away from Capitalism. They might call it Cronyism or Crony Capitalism. If the semantical barriers are broken down, a common ground opens up.
        In general, I am convinced the political heterogeneity in the Bitcoin community is a healthy thing. It forces people outside of their political echo chambers and confronts them with different beliefs making it necessary to reevaluate their ideas and opinions. As humans, we have a tough time being objective about a topic unless we are indifferent. Karl Popper, a very influential philosopher from Austria, has argued that one can only approach objective scientific truth collectively via continuous honest, intellectual debate <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264547">[2]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most critical motivator for the Bitcoin community is the fight against corruption enabled by special interest groups having more rights than others because of their hierarchical position in the financial system. Which arguably gives them influence and power in a disproportionate, unfair manner. Our society justifies this control distribution because it is used for the good (price stability, easing financial crisis, etc.) <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/16/20/Monetary-Policy-and-Central-Banking">[3]</a>. The Bitcoin community puts this thesis into question. The argument is that the system has long gone corrupt. Increasing amounts of purchasing power are taken out of the working citizens and used to finance bailouts for failed corporations, state bureaucracy, wars, or political corruption. Apart from these direct effects, society also pays the price for these measures via (hyper)inflation, asset-price-inflation, economic colonialism, wealth inequality via the Cantillon effect, and other secondary effects <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.austriancenter.com/cantillon-effect-populism/">[5]</a> <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">[6]</a>. These, of course, often are attempted to be hidden away or blamed on other things <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/">[7]</a>. Bitcoin, functioning uninterruptedly now for over 13 years, provides a compelling case that a financial system is possible without a central organ of power and, therefore, without the potential for corruption that goes along with it.<br/>
        I would argue that unless you are in a beneficiary position of the current system yourself or are convinced by the idea that this type of central power is necessary to keep our economy and society in order, it's challenging to deny that Bitcoin's highest aim is a desirable, noble one.

    <h2>Bitcoin and social equality</h2>

    <p class="img-subtxt">All of these individuals are treated equally in the Bitcoin network. The network only knows users. Everybody is free to become a user and every user has equal rights.</p>

    <p>
        As the blocksize war <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">[8]</a> has brilliantly demonstrated, it does not matter how much Bitcoin you have, how much mining power you are operating, or if you are the head of large Bitcoin/Crypto cooperation, or an influential Bitcoin developer. Bitcoin doesn't care if you are the president of the United States, the wealthiest person on the planet, a refugee fleeing war, or living as a woman in a country that does not respect your financial rights. In Bitcoin there are no privileges.
        Whatever financial privilege you currently enjoy by having access to a relatively stable national currency or by being able to lend out money that you don't even have, in a Bitcoin world, it doesn't matter.

    <p class="img-subtxt">Bitcoin deletes your financial privilege.</p>
    <p>
        As a Bitcoin user, you have exactly two options: Play by the rules, or leave.
        Over the years, discovering this fact famously made some individuals go crazy. As their megalomanic attempts to change the laws of the network failed, the only thing left for them to do was to leave. Then create their own version of the network with rules adjusted to their ideal and desperately try to convince others that your new version of Bitcoin is the right one. Unsurprisingly those attempts have not been very successful.

        As I have laid out in An Analogy between Bitcoin and Chess <a href="https://jakob.wtf/article/analogy-between-bitcoin-and-chess">[9]</a>, the most critical aspect of Bitcoin is that nobody has the power or authority to alter its rules. This fact is what makes it a suitable medium for being good money. And this is also the one thing that makes Bitcoin different from conventional currencies controlled and managed by a hierarchy of banks, with the central banks on top. It is also different from other Cryptocurrencies. Even the most significant Altcoins have repeatedly demonstrated that their networks can be halted or rolled back, and their rules changed whenever a core group deems it necessary <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/history/">[10]</a>. From that perspective alternative Cryptocurrencies are not much different from national currencies, except they are not mandated and therefore face market competition. As F.A. Hayek argued in 1976 <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf">[11]</a>, market competition would force the money operators to be more conservative, as otherwise, customers could move to competing money provider. If there is demand for human-controlled money next to Bitcoin, or if the human-controlled version will be superior after all, is an open question. History is in Bitcoin's favor, as the money used most widely for the most prolonged period is gold and gold derivatives. Gold has a supply that is inelastic, similar to Bitcoin. Even though since 1971, currencies aren't tied to gold anymore, it has still kept its role as a store of value especially for the central banks that are the largest holders of gold. In contrast, all human-controlled currency has failed to function as, ultimately, they lost their purchasing power <a href="https://saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/">[12]</a>.

    <h2>Bitcoin is the hero</h2>

    <p>According to Carl Jung's theory of the unconscious archetypes <a href="https://archive.org/details/archetypescollec0000jung">[13]</a>, there exists a hero figure that we can find in stories or myths that confronts the dragon, withstands it, and eventually wins the fight to claim its treasure. The hero is often accompanied by a wise old man, another archetypal figure that assists the hero on his path with his knowledge and wisdom but eventually leaves him on his own. <br/>
        The Bitcoin story is indeed an archetypical one. Satoshi, the mysterious inventor of the Bitcoin system, who was undoubtedly wise (although not necessarily old), spawned the hero intending to fight the dragon, which is the corruption that has managed to sneak its way into our monetary system. Eventually, Satoshi disappeared and left Bitcoin on its own. Bitcoin is the hero fighting for <span class="emph">equality before the money</span>. In a peaceful, sly, roundabout way (as Friedrich Hayek once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-k_Fc63tZI">[14]</a>), the network takes power away from those with most of it and hands it to every individual willing to accept the responsibility (holding your own Bitcoin indeed requires a fair amount of responsibility <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-zXEsJ61U">[15]</a>).

        According to Carl Jung, the hero has to overcome many obstacles and confront and integrate his shadow, his personal dark side. In 2011 Ross Ulbricht launched the Silk Road. A black market operating on the darknet on which one could buy or sell drugs for Bitcoin. This initially put Bitcoin in a dark light and associated it with illegal activity. It was at this time that Satoshi disappeared. In 2013 the FBI took down the market <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210224193315/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/">[16]</a>.<br/>
        Additionally, the most significant Bitcoin exchange at those times, Mt.Gox, having about 80% of global trading volume, was hacked with about 650.000 to 850.000 coins lost <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/mt-gox-bitcoin-hack-teaches-us-today">[17]</a>. Many assumed the end of Bitcoin had come, and the price crashed from about $1160 to $155. But surprisingly, Bitcoin survived and managed to recover.
        Between 2015 and 2017, the to-date largest attack upon Bitcoins immutable rules was played out. Some central players wanted to change Bitcoin's block size to increase scalability. At one point, most exchanges, the biggest mining pools, and many prominent figures in the space all agreed on executing the rule change. A rule change would have created a new Bitcoin version that is incompatible with the old one, compromising Bitcoins most integral feature, its ability to prevent rule changes. Yet the attempt eventually failed, and again Bitcoin survived and grew <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">[8]</a>.<br/>
        These are only a few excerpts of the Bitcoin network's hardships. There were also countless drops in USD denominated price, often more than 80%, political attacks, attacks from Altcoins.
        At present Bitcoin has been declared dead 447 times by media and prominent figures <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/">[18]</a>. In reality Bitcoin is still alive; the network is bigger than ever and continues to grow. There are currenlty 15.150 reachable Bitcoin nodes <a href="https://bitnodes.io/">[19]</a>. While writing An Analogy Between Bitcoin and Chess in 2020 it was about 10.000 <a href="https://jakob.wtf/article/analogy-between-bitcoin-and-chess">[9]</a>. Demand for the currency is increasing, and to date, not a single Altcoin managed to rise higher than Bitcoin in market cap. We have yet to see what obstacles await our hero in the future, but one thing is for sure, Bitcoin won't go down without a fight.
