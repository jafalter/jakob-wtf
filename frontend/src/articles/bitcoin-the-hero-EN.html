        I have been a member of the Bitcoin community for many years now. I find it especially interesting that Bitcoin followers come from diverse political spectrums. People from the left and right suddenly manage to find common grounds as they discover that their goals can be surprisingly aligned.<br/>
        A common theme in the left-wing community is, for instance, the negative stance against capitalism. Initially, somebody from the right would have a problem with this sentiment because their views are generally pro-capitalism. If you try to understand what capitalism means for both parties, you will learn they mean two different things. The left will associate with capitalism mega corporations getting unfairly rich through corruption, lobbying, or exploitation. Now for the right-wing person, capitalism means free markets, people peacefully working for each other, without the corruptive manipulations imposed by the state or other organizations with ties to the government. From this angle, those two groups will realize that they are fundamentally fighting for similar goals. I am convinced the political heterogeneity in the Bitcoin community is a very healthy thing. It forces people to go outside of their political echo chambers and confront themselves with different beliefs making it necessary to reevaluate their ideas and opinions. As humans, we have a tough time being objective about a topic unless we are indifferent. Karl Popper has therefore argued that one can only approach objective scientific truth collectively via continuous honest intellectual debate from both sides <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.264547">[1]</a>.
    </p>

        As I see it, the most critical motivator for the Bitcoin community is the fight against corruption enabled by special interest groups having more rights than others because of their hierarchical position in the financial system. Which arguably gives them influence and power in a disproportionate, unfair manner. Our society justifies this control distribution because it allegedly is used for the good (Price stability, avoiding financial crisis, etc.) <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/16/20/Monetary-Policy-and-Central-Banking">[2]</a>. The Bitcoin community puts this thesis into question. The argument is that the system has long gone corrupt. Increasing amounts of purchasing power are taken out of the working citizens and used to finance bailouts for failed corporations, state bureaucracy, wars, or political corruption. Apart from these direct effects, we also pay the price for these measures via inflation, asset-price-inflation, economic colonialism, wealth inequality via the Cantillon effect, hyperinflation, and other secondary effects <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.austriancenter.com/cantillon-effect-populism/">[4]</a> <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">[5]</a>. These, of course, often are attempted to be hidden away or blamed on other things <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/">[6]</a>. Bitcoin, functioning uninterruptedly now for over 13 years, provides a compelling case that a financial system is possible without that central organ of power and, therefore, without the potential for corruption that goes along with it.<br/>
        I would argue that unless you are in a beneficiary position of the current system yourself or are convinced by the idea that this type of central power is necessary to keep our economy and society in order, it is hard to find a problem with this fundamental motivation.

    <h2>Bitcoin and social equality</h2>

    <p>
        As the blocksize war <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">[7]</a> has brilliantly demonstrated, it does not matter how much Bitcoin you have, how much mining power you are operating, or if you are the head of large Bitcoin/Crypto cooperation or an influential Bitcoin developer. Bitcoin doesn't care if you are the president of the united state, the wealthiest person on the planet, or a homosexual dwarf living alone in the jungle. There are no privilges.
        Whatever financial privilege you currently enjoy, in a Bitcoin world, it's gone.

    <p>
        As a Bitcoin user, you have exactly two options: Join the network, play by the rules, or leave.
        Over the years, discovering this fact famously made some individuals go crazy. As their megalomanic attempts to change the laws of the network failed, the only thing left for them to do was to leave. Then create their own version of the network with rules adjusted to their ideal and desperately try to convince others that your new version of Bitcoin is the right one. Unsurprisingly those attempts have not been very successful.

        As I have laid out in An Analogy between Bitcoin and Chess <a href="https://jakob.wtf/article/analogy-between-bitcoin-and-chess">[8]</a> , the most critical aspect of Bitcoin is that nobody has the power or authority to alter its rules. This fact is what makes it a suitable medium for being good money. And this is also the one thing that makes Bitcoin different from conventional currencies controlled and managed by a hierarchy of banks, with the central banks on top. It is also different from other Cryptocurrencies. Even the most significant Altcoins have repeatedly demonstrated that their networks can be halted or rolled back, and their rules changed whenever a core group deems it necessary. From that perspective <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/history/">[9]</a>. Alternative Cryptocurrencies are not much different from national currencies, except they are not mandated and therefore face market competition. As F.A. Hayek argued in 1976 <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf">[10]</a>, market competition would force the money operators to be more conservative, as otherwise, customers could move to competing money provider. If there is demand for human-controlled money next to Bitcoin, or if the human-controlled version will be superior after all, is an open question. History is in Bitcoins favor, as the most successful money in human history is gold, which has a similarly inelastic supply as Bitcoin. In contrast, all human-controlled currency has failed to function eventually <a href="https://saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/">[11]</a>.

    <h2>Bitcoin is the hero</h2>

    <p>According to Carl Jung's theory of the unconscious archetypes <a href="https://archive.org/details/archetypescollec0000jung">[12]</a> , there exists a hero figure that we can find in stories or myths that confronts the dragon, withstands it, and eventually wins the fight to claim its treasure. The hero is often accompanied by a wise old man, another archetypal figure that assists the hero on his path with his knowledge and wisdom but eventually leaves him on his own. <br/>
        The Bitcoin story is indeed an archetypical one. Satoshi, the mysterious inventor of the Bitcoin system, who was undoubtedly wise (although not necessarily old), spawned the hero intending to fight the dragon, which is the corruption that has managed to sneak its way into our monetary system. Eventually, Satoshi disappeared and left Bitcoin on its own. Bitcoin is the hero fighting for <span class="emph">equality before the money</span>. In a sly, roundabout way (as Friedrich Hayek once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-k_Fc63tZI">[13]</a> ), the network takes power away from those with most of it and hands it to every individual willing to accept the responsibility (holding your own Bitcoin indeed requires a fair amount of responsibility <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-zXEsJ61U">[13]</a>).

        Like every hero, Bitcoin has to overcome obstacles. In its 13 years of existence, Bitcoin has gone through a lot. In 2011 Ross Ulbricht launched the Silk Road. A black market operating on the darknet on which one could buy or sell drugs for Bitcoin. This initially put Bitcoin in a very dark corner and associated it with illegal activity. It was at this time that Satoshi disappeared. In 2013 the FBI took down the market.<br/>
        Additionally, the most significant Bitcoin exchange at those times, Mt.Gox, having about 80% of global trading volume, was hacked with about 650.000 to 850.000 coins lost. Many assumed the end of Bitcoin had come, and the price crashed from about $1160 to $155. But surprisingly, Bitcoin survived and managed to recover.
        Between 2015 and 2017, the to-date largest attack upon Bitcoins immutable rules was played out. Some central players wanted to change Bitcoin's block size to increase scalability. At one point, most exchanges, the biggest mining pools, and many prominent figures in the space all agreed on executing the rule change. A rule change would have created a new Bitcoin version that is incompatible with the old one, compromising Bitcoins most sacred feature, its ability to withstand rule changes. Yet the attempt eventually failed, and again Bitcoin survived and grew. <br/>
        These are only a few excerpts of the Bitcoin network's hardships. There were also countless drops in USD denominated price, often more than 80%: political attacks, attacks from Altcoins. So far, all of them have failed. Bitcoin is still alive; the network is bigger than ever and continues to grow. Demand for the currency is increasing, and to date, not a single Altcoin managed to rise higher than Bitcoin in market cap. We have yet to see what obstacles await our hero in the future, but one thing is for sure, Bitcoin won't go down in an easy fight.
