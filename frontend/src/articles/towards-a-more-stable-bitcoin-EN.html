        Recently, I listened to a very intriguing debate about whether gold will remain an important type of money in
        the 21st century, or if Bitcoin will challenge the monetary metal's status. Gold expert <a href="https://twitter.com/RealKeithWeiner">Keith Weiner</a> defended gold while
        podcaster and long time Bitcoin writer <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinPierre">Pierre Rochard</a> argued for Bitcoin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNPHUTuRXeA">[1]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On several occasions in the discussion, Bitcoin's volatility was brought up as a major problem, with its quick rises and subsequent drawdowns of up to 80% in USD terms. Keith argued how a Bitcoin borrower could face major problems if the Bitcoin price rises 50% and now suddenly they have to pay back a substantially higher amount (valued in USD). Also, the question came up that if Bitcoin continues to be so volatile such that drops in purchasing power of 70% or even 20% are possible, how can it ever be useful money? Pierre argues that even looking at foreign exchanges today, some currencies are arguably quite volatile. Even a consumer price index of 9% could be classified as volatile, and also points out that real estate is volatile too, yet a widely used store of value. Essentially, he argues that the price of money can fluctuate and that is okay in a free market. Stability could only be achieved by introducing a flexible monetary policy, which then (again) opens the door for corruption. He also argues that one could hedge against volatility in the Bitcoin price, for instance, by buying futures, or simply holding more Bitcoin. I have a different view on the matter which inspired me to write this article.

    <p>
        A similar critique can be found by the writer Joakim Book <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-price-action-does-matter">[2]</a>. He explains that someone who saved in Bitcoin last year would now be left with 30% of their purchasing power in the worst-case scenario, which is a serious issue that should not be overlooked. I agree, and in my view of all the criticism against Bitcoin I've heard over the years, price volatility remains the best one, which is why I have decided to think about it more deeply.
    </p>

    <h2>What is stability?</h2>

    <p>
        In my view, before we go further to discuss Bitcoin's stability, we would have to, first of all, define what we consider stable, and here we have already entered a tricky subject. In the minds of most people, stability would be measured against other big currencies, such as the US dollar or perhaps the Euro, Pound, Yen or Swiss Franc. In that perspective, stability would be reached if Bitcoin traded more conservatively, for instance, if its USD price were to change by not more than 5% YoY. I think it is safe to say that this type of stability is unlikely to ever be reached, as, at present, 5% price changes can happen in a single day.
    </p>

    <p>
        A better way to define stability would be by looking at the purchasing power of Bitcoin for economic goods. For instance, Friedrich Hayek, in his book "The Denationalisation of Money", approached stability as stable prices of a set of raw materials and other first-order goods in an economy <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf">[3]</a>. Similarly, we could measure stability in metrics such as the consumer price index. If we try to evaluate Bitcoin under this type of stability measurement, we must realize that we are faced with an important problem. Namely, at present, Bitcoin does not directly trade against raw materials or consumer products. Even in those cases where Bitcoin is a national legal tender, the merchants price their goods in USD, not in Bitcoin, and the consumer could purchase an item with an amount of Bitcoin equal to the USD-denominated price. That means currently, our only option to measure Bitcoin's stability would be other currencies, or products and other assets that are denominated in other currencies.
    </p>

    <h2>How can stability be achieved?</h2>

    <p>
        I would argue that the only way for Bitcoin to achieve a notion of economic stability, prices must be denominated in Bitcoin (or Satoshis); that is, goods and services must directly trade against Bitcoin.<br/>
        This could happen in two ways: Either some communities or villages adopt Bitcoin as their local means of exchange, which could happen if the majority of people in that community use Bitcoin as their main money and the legislation allows it, such as in El Salvador. Grassroots movements such as Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte already come close to this, but to my knowledge, even there, prices remain to be denominated in USD. Alternatively, if a country adopts Bitcoin or a currency pegged to Bitcoin as its primary national currency, we as well would witness bitcoin denominated price formation.<br/>
        The first chance of seeing this happening could be in the Central African Republic. The president announced in the spring of 2022 that he was following El Salvador in making Bitcoin legal tender. More specifically, though, they do still want to issue their own currency, the Sango coin, which should be implemented as a Bitcoin sidechain and be backed directly by Bitcoin <a href="https://sango.org/genesis-paper.pdf">[4]</a>. If this were to play out and if this new currency were to become the dominant money in the region, we could for the first time see Bitcoin price formation of goods and services, in my mind the most critical step toward a "stable" Bitcoin. Until that happens, we remain in an early adoption phase in which the only users of Bitcoin are those that value it as a long-term savings asset, as a means for trading to increase their fiat currency holdings, to escape authoritarian regimes, or as a means of sending and receiving payments internationally cheaply without the risk of confiscation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me describe how a Bitcoin-denominated economy could play out and how it might result in a more stable Bitcoin.<br/>
        Imagine a country in which the majority of citizens hold Bitcoin (or a currency backed by Bitcoin) as their main form of money, which would mean Bitcoin is the most liquid good in the economy. In that case, directly selling goods and services for Bitcoin makes the most sense, as one will have reached the vast majority of potential customers. Price formation now happens based on how much Bitcoin is held in this country. The more Bitcoin is distributed in that community, the higher merchants can set their prices while still being able to find buyers. In such a scenario, the foreign exchange rate of Bitcoin against other currencies would not matter as much anymore (At least inside the community). Evidence for this argument can already be seen in today's world. For example, the Euro has lost nearly 20% of its value against the US dollar in the last year. Yet prices did not rise 20% in the Eurozone. The consumer price index in the Eurozone is roughly in the same zone as it is in the US. If you travel through Europe you will also notice that prices vary in different countries, even though all use the same currency.<br/>
        Of course, foreign exchange has an influence on exports and imports; thereby, foreign exchange rates can indirectly influence prices, especially if our Bitcoin region is small and the total amount of Bitcoin distributed in the region is tiny.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the foreign exchange price of Bitcoin falls, people outside the region could exchange their currency for Bitcoin and purchase goods and services inside the region cheaply. Therefore, the amount of Bitcoin in the region is growing, and eventually it will make economic sense for merchants to raise their prices and still find buyers. Similarly, if Bitcoins' foreign exchange rate rises, individuals in the area could convert their Bitcoins into foreign currency, move outside the region, and now buy more goods and services as before. This means bitcoins are moved out of the region, which eventually could lead to merchants inside the country having to lower their prices if they want to be able to sell all of their goods.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thinking about it this way, we can already see how such a development could lead to a more stable Bitcoin exchange rate. As the Bitcoin price falls, it creates additional demand for Bitcoin from people outside the region wanting to buy cheaper goods inside the region. As Bitcoin price rises, it reduces demand for Bitcoin as individuals sell their Bitcoin for foreign currency to buy cheap goods outside of the region. This creats a sort of control mechanism for the Bitcoin exchange rate. The more and the bigger the regions are that adopt such a standard, the stronger this control mechanism would be.
    </p>

    <h2>Money supply and uncertainty</h2>

    <p>
        Finally, I want to briefly touch on another point brought up by Pierre in the debate. One important property of money is insurance against future uncertainty. The higher the perceived future uncertainty, the higher the demand for holding money. This can be seen clearly in times of sudden higher uncertainty, such as at the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, where prices of most assets were falling rapidly. When demand for money grows, businesses would have to resort to lowering prices; otherwise, they might end up selling much less and making less profit than if they had lowered their prices. This is particularly dangerous when the debt in the system is high, because with a higher price of money the value of the debt increases, making it harder to pay back loans. Especially if interest rates on those loans were already low in the first place and can't be lowered further. This could eventually lead to defaults with catastrophic damage, as was the case in the 2008 financial crisis. However, in a world of elastic money, the central bank can step in and help in such a case by increasing the supply of money. Therefore, they are filling the increased demand for money without businesses having to lower prices, with the downside of creating potential price rises in the future, as the total amount of money in the system is increased (also something we have witnessed in recently).

    <p>
        Another criticism is that Bitcoin, being the only money with strictly inelastic money, does not allow this type of intervention. My short response to this critique is that I believe a Bitcoin-based economy would be savings-based instead of debt-based. With an ever-decreasing number of newly issued Bitcoins, the best strategy is to hold as much Bitcoin as possible. Whereas with our current system, in which the set goal is to devalue the currency by about 2% every year, the best strategy is to hold as much debt as possible, because it will also devalue by an equal amount, as is argued by Saifedean Ammous in his book The Fiat Standard <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard/">[5]</a>. In a Bitcoin economy, nations might be swimming in savings instead of being heavily indebted. Therefore, the purchasing power of Bitcoin going up would be less catastrophic, perhaps even beneficial, as goods and servies would continuesly get easier to afford, leading to rises in living standards. In times of increased uncertainty, entities with huge Bitcoin savings could be using their savings to mitigate damage, instead of having to take on more debt.
    </p>

    <p>
        This, however, is only speculation. One could also argue that changes in monetary policy are themselves a form of uncertainty. As we have seen clearly in 2022, markets did react quite heavily to policy changes announced by the central banks. In a Bitcoin world, this element of uncertainty would be eliminated, potentially leading to greater future certainty and therefore more investment and higher rates of employment.
