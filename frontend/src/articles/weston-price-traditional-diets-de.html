    Today I want to discuss my favorite book on nutrition and probably one of the most influencal books I have ever read in general. The book is called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration and was written by Dr. Weston Price in 1939. The title was initially a bit offputting to me as it sounds like one of the numerous modern, ideologic diet books. Weston Prices' book is not of that kind. The studies presented in this book are some of the best I have ever heard of and are a perfect example of scientific research in general.
Weston Price was a dentist concerned with the decline in modern humanity's overall health and fitness and set out to discover the reasons thereof. Like many other excellent scientists, Price's believed that we can learn plenty by studying wisdom embedded in primitive culture. With air travel becoming available during that time, Price set out to explore primitive tribes all around the globe, examining their health status and specifically gathering insight into their nutritional habits.
What makes this study so scientifically valuable is the study setup: Price was interested in two groups of primitive tribes: Those completely self-sufficient, without or very limited contact to a modernized society, and those who recently made this contact and specifically started to rely on imported food. With this setup, we have a sound design for a scientific experiment. Only a single variable has changed, which is the contact and trade with modernized society. And this single variable is stricly controlled by the environment. Such a setup is actually what we would aim for in a clinical trial. If a change in health can be observed between those two groups, this changing variable could likely be a causal factor of the observed outcome. Price also avoids another problem that is often present in modern studies. He does not look for a specific macronutrient distribution or other specific dietary factor. What specific food the primitive tribes consume is irrelevant, as long as it is produced and gathered by the group itself, rather then imported. Thereby precisely measuring exactly what, when and what quantities of food are eaten is not as important. Another property of a valueable scientific study is when one can repeat it and observe the same results in different environments. Weston Price did not only study a single primitive tribe. He repeated the same experiment 13 times in entirely different parts of the world during his travels, eliminating potential other influential factors such as climate or altidude. In all 13 primitive groups, which I will describe later in more detail, Price discovered the same result: Once the tribe adopted modernized food, individual health deteriorated, sometimes very rapidly and critically. Price sees the lower nutritional value of modern food compared to that eaten by the primitives as the main reason for this effect. After examining food samples of the primitive tribes in his lab, he found that compared to modern food, their contents of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and vitamins were always increased significantly, sometimes up to 50 fold, which I will also discuss in the later sections of the article.
There are, of course, some things we can criticize. This study was one of the first-ever conducted studies in nutrition, and therefore methodology in examining health status was nothing like it would be today. In a modern survey, one would collect blood samples and obtain several biomarkers, rates of death, disease etc. Prices' health examination was instead very much observational. Specifically, as a dentist, he focused on teeth as a marker for health. The occurrence of caries, the formation of teeth, and facial structure were his prime observation targets. But he also conducted statements about general susceptibility to common diseases such as tuberculosis or arthritis. He examined general fitness, and the overall need for medical care, for instance, during childbirth. He collected food samples he then examined in his laboratory and took photos of the people and sometimes skulls. Despite the more primitive methods of observation, general health outcomes, which should be the main focus of such a study, are still reflected very well. Also relying too much on biomarkers as a proxy for health, or disease risk, as is often done in modern studies, can sometimes be misleading. An interesting example of this is, for instance, aterial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly with getting a stroke. This study [1] shows that endurance sports such as running or swimming increase the incidence of AF. But can we conclude from that that running or swimming is bad for you and should be avoided?
If you don't trust Prices examinations, other scientists did similar experiments and came to the same conclusions. Despite the unbalanced, meat-heavy diet, Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson, an early explorer of the arctic that lived with the Inuit for a while found them in splendid health [3]. Stefansson later even successfully replicated the meat-only diet on himself in a clinical setting [3]. Peter Heinbecker also studied the Inuit, also collecting their blood work [4]. G.V. Mann et al. studied the African Masai tribe in 1964 (Price studied the same tribe too, as we will see later), confirming their health status by measuring biomarkers like serum cholesterol values [5].
Another criticism I have read is that Price's work does not apply to our modern world because if was done before food fortification (artificially adding vitamins and minerals to foodstuff) was common, but I beg to differ. Claiming the nutritional value of commonly consumed food has increased rather than decreased over the past 100 years seems absurd to me, considering the rise of fast food and ever new industrial food processing methods to extend shelf lives and produce food cheaper. As a root evil, Price saw white flour and sugar products. White flour is flour made out only of a part of the grain (the endosperm). Doing this increases the product's shelf life dramatically, thereby reducing its price but also nutritional value as the other parts of the grain are missing. When this was discovered, food manufacturers "fixed" the problem by artificially adding back vitamins to the flour. However, to show that food fortification fixed the problem, one would have to repeat Price's experiment and show that the results are now different. To my knowledge, that has never been done. Also, looking, for instance, into a more modern observational study like the China study, we find that wheat flour consumption even today still correlates significantly with disease [2], so most probably the fortification "fix" is not good enough.
Before I start to go into details, here is another reason why Price's study might be so appealing to many. To quote George Orwell, "The best books are those that tell you what you know already." The whole study and its outcome seem logical. Even though our modern lifespan is much higher than primitive tribes due to the advances in modern medicine, increased safety, hygiene, and standard of living, arguing that modernized people are physically healthier than primitive ones would almost be absurd. There is no doubt that, in general, we are much more susceptible to diseases of all kinds as well as being more fragile both physically and mentally. While there might be many reasons for this, Price uncovers at least one critical reason for this circumstance.
In the following, I will lay out the 13 experiments and show what the indigenous people ate.

<h2>Modernized And Isolated Swiss</h2>

<div>
Price wanted to study an isolated group of people in high elevation for which he went to Switzerland. After conducting with the Swiss government about the endeavor, he went to a group of people living in the mountains in Lötschental [1]. The Lötschberg tunnel was just completed which enabled Price to visit a previously very hard-to-reach isolated group of people living off only locally-produced foods. The enclosing in three mountains and frequently occurring landslides made entering or leaving the village previously very dangerous, thus forcing their inhabitants to rely on locally produced food only. Around 2000 people had neither a physician nor a dentist, as there was little need for them. Upon physical examination, Price found them to be in excellent health, having an incredible physique and sound, virtually caries-free teeth. (Average number of cavities per person was 0.3) Nutrition in this village evolved heavily around dairy. The growing boys and girls were given a slice of whole rye bread and a piece of summer-made cheese, eaten with fresh milk of goats and cows. Villagers consumed meat once a week. The inhabitants highly valued the dairy products produced from the milk of early summer. After examination in the lab, Price found those to be of much higher nutritional value than regular dairy products. 
Price then moved on to visit a nearby similarly isolated group of people in Visperterminen. Those people also grow vineyard so also get additional nutrition from wine and fruit. Apart from that, their diet was similar to that found in Lötschberg, with high dairy consumption, rye, occasionally meat, and potatoes. The inhabitants ate limited green foods during summer, bones and scraps were utilized for making soups. Price's again examined their health and found them to be in similarly good condition as the people in Lötschberg. Price was particularily impressed by a woman of 62 years who carried an enormous load of rye on her back and in his words was extraordinarily well developed and well preserved.
Weston Price then went on to study some other nearby villages, one of them Vissoie, a town that had already adopted modern foods such as white-flour goods, jams, marmalades, and syrups, received from trade. Upon examination, Price's found 20.2 out of 100 affected with caries, compared to 3.4 in the previous village (And that even though the more primitive villages often didn't even use toothbrushes). He also had the opportunity to study skulls of deceased persons and found that facial deformities, missing teeth, and cavities could be found in persons who died more recently in this town. Price talked to dentists in some more modernized villages who reported that up to 95% of the population are suffering from caries in some areas.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Gaelics</h2>

<div>
Next, Price went to the Isle of Lewis [2], an island off the northwest coast of Scotland. Around 20.000 people lived in that village that mainly consisted of fisherfolk and sheep raisers. He pointed out that the pasture of the island is very poor, which is why one can find almost no cattle or trees. The primary foods of these islanders are fish, small seafood, including lobsters, crabs, oysters, clams, and oat products with a bit of barley. Porridge and oatcakes are eaten regularly with each meal. A popular food was baked cod's head stuffed with chopped cod's liver and oatmeal. The villagers lived in so-called black houses. Those are stone houses with a fireplace and chimney. The thatch is replaced every year and used as fertilizer for their soil. Price was surprised by the robust physique of the people with perfectly formed teeth, with only 1.3 out of hundred infected with caries. Next, Price's traveled to some smaller islands close by, of which in one dairy products and fruit were practically unknown. The population there lived off fish, seafood, and a minimal amount of vegetable foods. Lobsters and flatfish are an essential part of their foods. The physiques of these people again were found to be remarkably fine. 
He then went to the modernized section of Stornoway, where the situation was different. People could purchase angel food cake, white flour products, canned marmalade, canned vegetables, sweetened fruit juice, and jams. In a count, 25 out of 100 examined people already were wearing artificial teeth even though their age was between 20 and 40. Finally, Price studied two brothers, of which one was insisting on modern food, while the other was still living off mostly of oatmeal, seafood, and limited dairy products. It was also noted that the modernized population was much less resistant to tuberculosis. It was being thought that the thatched-roof house was a significant contributing factor to this development, notwithstanding that former generations had been free from the disease. Interestingly enough nutrition did not came to their minds as a plausible reason. Price studied children at a place called Scalpay, living off oatmeal porridge, oatcake, and seafood. One tooth out of every hundred was attacked by tooth decay, and their physical development was excellent. Only 10 miles away in Tabert, where people have access to modernized food, children had 32.4 carious teeth out of every hundred.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Eskimos</h2>

<div>
To study primitive Eskimos, who manage to survive in a very harsh climate, Weston Price went to the south of Yukon Delta [1]. A government station has been established at the Kuskokwim River, which made modern foods available for limited districts delivered via boats. A significant number of Eskimos, however, still live without or only slight contact with this food. To reach those isolated communities, Price had to travel via plane. He studied teeth from Eskimos and Indians living in Crooked Creek, Napimute, Sleet Mute, Bethel, Kokamute, Bethel Island, and some living on the Stony River. Again those living on foods provided by the government had a significantly higher rate of tooth decay. In Bethel, he studied 88 individuals, of which 11.6 percent had been attacked by tooth decay. Of these 88 individuals, 27 lived almost exclusively on natural foods. Price found only one single tooth of these 27 persons with dental caries. Forty individuals lived almost exclusively on shipped supplies, and of their 1094 teeth, 252, or 21.1 percent, had been attacked by tooth decay. Of the remaining 21 individuals that lived partly on native, partly on imported foods, 6.3% of their teeth were attacked. In some of the groups living on native foods, only astonishingly few (&lt;0.1%) were affected by tooth decay. In some groups, not a single tooth was found that was affected by dental caries. Price was very impressed by the physical development and strength displayed by the primitive Eskimos. He also studied residents of McGrath and Holy Cross that have been consuming modernized foods for many years. The rate of tooth decay found here was as high as 41%. Price also notes the significant changes (narrowing) in the generations' facial and dental arch form after adopting modernized food.
The Eskimos almost always have their homes near deep water. During the salmon running season, they store large quantities of dried salmon. They also were experts in spearing seals from their kayaks. Seal oil provides an essential part of the Eskimos' nutrition. After examining in the lab, Prices found these oils to be one of the richest Vitamin A-containing foods he ever encountered. Dried Fish eggs were essential foods, especially for small children. They further ate caribou, groundnuts, kelp, berries, blossoms of flowers preserved in seal oil, sorrel grass preserved in seal oil, and quantities of frozen fish. One of the most vital food factor consists of the organs of the large animals of the sea, including specific layers of the skin of whales, which were exceptionally high in vitamin c. Dispite living in a very inhospitable part of the world with nine or ten months of winter in spite of the absence for long periods of plant food, dairy products and eggs, the Eskimos were able to provide their bodies with all the mineral and vitamin requirements from sea food, stored greens, berris and plants from the sea.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized North American Indians</h2>

<div>
Price went on to study some Indian tribes in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. There the tribes still lived without much influence of modernized society. They lived in accord with the Eskimos but did not intermarry. It was of particular interest to Price to find a group that could not obtain the animal life of the sea, not even the running salmon. Together with two guides, Price traveled down waterways toward the Arctic on the Diese and Liard Rivers. The trip made it possible for him to make contact with large bands of Indians.
The diet of those native Americans is almost entirely limited to the wild animals of the chase. Their principal large animal was the moose and caribou. The temperature could reach -70° F (-56° C) in the winter, making it impossible to maintain dairy animals or grow seed cereals or fruits. Only during summer growing plants could be used. During winter some use was made of bark and buds of trees. They put great emphasis upon the eating of the organs of the animals. Much of the muscle meat was fed to the dogs. They also extracted nutritive value from the bones, consuming the marrow, that was especially prepared for growing children. Price described the people as exceptionally kind and hospitable. He was talking to one of the Indians about scurvy, what they called a white-man disease. He explained how they would eat the adrenal glands and organs to prevent it:
"When I asked an old Indian, through an interpreter, why the Indians did not get scurvy he replied promptly that that was a white man's disease. I asked whether it was possible for the Indians to get scurvy. He replied that it was, but said that the Indians know how to prevent it and the white man does not. When asked why he did not tell the white man how, his reply was that the white man knew too much to ask the Indian anything. I then asked him if he would tell me. He said he would if the chief said he might. He went to see the chief and returned in about an hour, saying that the chief said he could tell me because I was a friend of the Indians and had come to tell the Indians not to eat the food in the white man's store. He took me by the hand and led me to a log where we both sat down. He then described how when the Indian kills a moose he opens it up and at the back of the moose just above the kidney there are what he described as two small balls in the fat. These he said the Indian would take and cut up into as many pieces as there were little and big Indians in the family and each one would eat his piece. They would eat also the walls of the second stomach. By eating these parts of the animal the Indians would keep free from scurvy, which is due to the lack of vitamin C."
Modern science has discovered that the adrenal glands are the richest source of vitamin C in all animal and plant tissues. It is remarkable how primitive cultures have found and cultivated such wisdom without any modern science tools. In several groups studied in that area, Price found not a single tooth infected by tooth decay, and the dental arches and facial form were superb. As Price came down the Stikine River to the Alaskan frontier towns, where native Americans already consumed modernized foods, the dental caries problem increased up to 40 percent of all teeth. Their teeth were often severely deformed. Additionally, tuberculosis and arthritis were highly prevalent in these modernized Indians while being almost unheard of in primitive communities.
Prices went on to study the largest Indian Reservation in Canada, located in Brantford. The 4700 Indians there lived under highly modernized conditions. Price talked to the hospital's principal situated on that Reservation.  He said that the demand for beds had changed entirely in the twenty-eight years he had been there, mainly to maternity problems. He stated that in his period of contact, he had seen three generations of mothers. The grandmothers of the present generation would take a shawl and, either alone or accompanied by one family member, give birth to the baby without much difficulty or concern. The young mothers of the last generation are entirely different from their grandmothers or even mothers in their capacity and efficiency in reproduction. Most of them are brought to his hospital, and often surgical interference is necessary to make birth possible.
For comparison, Price made a study of an Indian reservation in New York State. There was evidence of a similarity of features in the older Indians who had not been highly modernized and had a striking deficiency in facial development and general health. Their diet consisted of plenty of white bread, canned vegetables, vegetable fats, jams, marmalades, sweetened goods, syrups, and confections. Milk was only available in limited amounts.
Price went on to study a reservation on Winnipeg Lake in Manitoba. The people there had been provided with fertile lands and taught modern methods of farming. Due to living close to a significant body of water, they had the opportunity to secure fish if they were disposed to make an effort to do so. Their homes, as well as their limited number of cattle and horses, were in poor condition. The people had been provided with a government school and a government agent to provide for their needs. They were within easy distance of hospitals and had available modern medical services. Despite all these advantages, their physical condition was very poor. 39.1 percent of all teeth studied were affected by dental caries. Over 90 percent of the individuals had rampant tooth decay.
Price also got the opportunity to study skulls of primitive Indians inhabiting the Pacific slope thousands or more years ago. The Vancouver Museum preserved those. He was astonished by their perfection of facial form and dental arches, with teeth completely free from dental caries. In comparison, the children living on a reservation in North Vancouver with modern conveniences and modern foods had 37% of their teeth attacked by caries.
He went on to study native Americans living in Vancouver Island, Ketchikan, Juneau, Sitka, Anchorage, Seward, Florida, and Albuquerque, all with contact to modernized foods and all suffering quite heavily from dental deformities, tooth decay, arthritis, and tuberculosis. In Florida again, Price had the opportunity to study skulls of prehistoric native Americans. Out of serval hundred heads taken from the burial mounds of southern Florida, Price found not a single tooth to have been attacked by tooth decay. Dental arch deformity or changes in facial form were also completely absent. Some groups of the Seminole tribe in Florida were still living in isolation with their hunting grounds. Those were hard to reach due to their inhospitality against modernized civilization. With the help of three guides, Price could take the desired measurements and found them to maintain a very high degree of physical excellence and high immunity to dental caries. Only four teeth in each hundred were found to have been attacked by tooth decay.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Melanesians</h2>

<div>
Now Price set out to study isolated people living in hot sultry climates of the tropics. He made an expedition to eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific to study groups of Melanesians and Polynesians for accomplishing this. Specifically, he traveled to New Caledonia [1] and the Fiji Islands [2]. There, Price made contact with groups of people from different racial stock speaking unique languages. Movement between the islands was made small crafts and sometimes airplanes. Government officials helped to provide local guides and interpreters. Reaching the isolated groups often required going over rough and challenging trails since most islands were volcanic and mountainous. Again Price conducted a physical examination, made measurements and photographs, and collected samples of foods, either dried or preserved in formalin. In many instances, these groups' only contact with modern civilization consists of the call of a small trading ship once or twice a year, where they traded dried coconut, seashells, and other such products for white flour, sugar, and clothes. However, due to the infrequency of trade, many isolated districts could not depart much from their native foods. The primitives often wore little clothing, covering their bodies with coconut oil, which absorbed the ultra-violet rays, thus preventing the tropical sun. Early navigators visiting these islands reported the people as exceedingly strong, vigorously built, and the islands as densely populated. In contrast with this, one now finds many of these islands' death rates exceeding birth rates, often seriously threatening the group's very existence.
Price describes the Melanesians living on the island of New Caledonia as broad-shouldered and very muscular, with physical development, including their teeth and dental arches of a very high order. The people believed they require seafood to maintain life and physical efficiency. Comparing the individuals living near the ports with those living in the isolated inland locations shows a marked increase in dental caries incidence (From 0.14% to 26%).
Next, Price traveled to the Fiji Islands. The inhabitants there were similar in physical development and appearance to the New Caledonians. The British empire colonizes the island. In the districts near the ports and on the islands with sugar plantations, degenerative diseases were rampant. Price tried to travel inland with the hopes of finding groups of people living entirely on plant foods for providing themselves with all the requirements of the body for growth and maintenance of good health. However, unfortunately, he was disappointed. He learned that even the hill and inland tribes regularly collected animal foods from the sea at least every three months. Other animal food sources were the wild pig from the bush, coconut crabs, which migrate to the sea from the mountains at certain seasons, and freshwater fish of various kinds. They also consumed fruits and plants from the mountains, which were available in abundance, of which Taro was one of the most important items. The incidence of dental caries was 30% of teeth examined for those people with contact to modern food and 0.42% for the more isolated groups. However, dental caries was much worse in the growing children and motherhood group due to the special demands of these individuals. The new generation born after the parents adopt the modern foods often have significant changes in the shape of the face and dental arches. No dentists were available on the islands; dental caries lead some islanders to commit suicide. Price talked with Ratu Popi [3], the hereditary king. He gave Price some information regarding the origin of cannibalism, relating it to recognizing special food values of special organs, particularly the livers.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Polynesians</h2>

<div>
Living close to the Melanesians, Price went on to study the Polynesians that were inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu group, the Tongan Islands, and the Samoan group.
The first group studied was made up of people of the Marquesas Islands [1]. Early navigators to those islands were recorded as enthusiastically admiring the beauty and excellence of the physical development of those people. Price described the situation when he visited there as exceptionally distressing. A French government official told him that the native population had decreased to about two thousand due to tuberculosis's ravages and smallpox and measles epidemics. Of about 100 people studied, Price noticed typical symptoms of tuberculosis in about 10 of them. Tooth decay also was rampant. The people there consumed trade food (white flour, sugar, canned goods) in conjunction with the land plants and fruits and ceased to depend on the sea for food. 36.7% of the tooth examined in this group were attacked by tooth decay. 
In Rarotonga [2] on the Cook Islands, Price found people living almost entirely on native foods. Examination of those has seen only 0.3% of the teeth have been attacked by caries. On the same island in Avarua, people again adopted trade food and saw 29.5% of their teeth attacked. He, however, notes that the situation here is much better than what he found in the Marquesans. The population is not seriously decreasing and is untroubled mainly except for the progressive development of degenerative diseases around the port area in the Avarua district.
In the Tongan islands, the people lived in nearly complete isolation except for a call from an infrequent trader. The people there are known as the greatest warriors of the Pacific and still lived under absolute monarchy and largely managed their own affairs. The irregular trade has forced many people to remain mainly on their native foods. For them, the incidence of dental caries was 0.6%. 
Price found a similarly positive picture on the Samoan Islands, where again large groups still lived on their native foods. He was told by local medical staff that this is one of the few groups of islands in which the native population is not rapidly decreasing but increasing instead. He explained that little medical aid is needed for these people. Practically all of their time is required for treating personnel and families of the Navy at this station.
All of the people in this area still living on native foods were using large quantities of seafood. The octopus, the sea crab, and the beche-de-mere (sea cucumber) were of high value and eaten raw. For cooking, underground ovens of hot stones were used.
On the Hawaiian Islands, Price faced great difficulty finding native groups of people living in isolation due to the significant number of foreigners that have moved to the islands. However, small groups could be found. Dental caries was about 2% of the teeth, with the control group (consisting of natives on the island having adopted modern food including white flours and sweets) having 37.3% of their teeth attacked. In the native population, Price noticed an interesting way of preparing Taro roots. After cooking them, they would dry and powder them, mix them with water and let them ferment for twenty-four hours or more. (The preparation is called "poi")

<h2>Isolated and Modernized African Tribes</h2>

<div>
The next destination in Price's journey was Africa. Due to it being the last continent invaded by modern civilization, it has one of the largest native populations still following inherited traditions. It was especially of interest to him to study tribes that live in the inner continent without access to liberal supplies of animal life of the sea. Price's journey started in Mombasa  [1], where he went across Kenya and Uganda into Congo. From there, he then traveled through Sudan into Egypt. In total, he came in contact with thirty different tribes. He noticed the impressive contrast in health and ruggedness between primitives in general and of the foreigners who have entered the country. Exposure to diseases, such as dysentery epidemics, was constant in this environment. Price himself was cautious about the food he ate, the water he drank, and always protecting against disease-carrying insects such as malaria mosquitos, tsetse flies, ticks, or jiggers. The natives often had developed immunity to the diseases that those insects carried.
Of the thirty tribes studied, in six, not a single tooth was attacked by dental caries, nor did Price find a single malformed dental arch. In thirteen tribes, not a single individual with irregular teeth was found. Several other tribes were found with near-complete immunity to dental caries. In contrast, in the tribes that adopted modern foods, many cases of tooth decay were found, and the next generation in these tribes frequently developed dental arch deformities.

The Masai Tribe: The Masai are a popular topic among nutrition researchers. In 1964 G. V. Mann found that the members of the tribe did not show any signs of atherosclerosis or elevated serum cholesterol even though eating a diet that consists primarily of meat and milk, using this as an argument against the causal role of saturated fat in heart disease.
The Masai is a native tribe in Kenya; Price described them as very strong and skilled. They were conducting surgical operations on their cattle. He also noted his impression that they have exposed tribe members infected with syphilis to malaria because they knew that would prevent serious injuries resulting from the spirochetal infection of the spinal cord and brain. For their food, they have depended very largely on milk, meat, and blood, reinforced with vegetables and fruits. They milk the cows daily and bleed the steers at regular intervals with an arrow. The blood is defibrinated by whipping in the gourd. The fibrin is fried or cooked much as someone would prepare bacon or meat. They use the defibrinated blood raw just as the milk is, except in smaller quantities. The growing children and pregnant or lactating women are the first to receive a day's ration of blood. These three sources, milk, blood, and meat, provide them with liberal supplies of body-building minerals and vitamins, both fat-soluble and water-soluble. They judge the value of a cow by the length of time it takes her calf to stand on its feet and run after it is born, which is only a few minutes. In the eighty-eight individuals of the Masai tribe, only four had dental caries. These had a total of ten carious teeth, which are 0.4% of the 2516 teeth examined. The rate of dental deformities was as low as 3.4%.

The Kikuyu Tribe, Kenya: The Kikuyu tribe is primarily agricultural and eats very differently from the Masai. Their chief articles of diet are sweet potatoes, corn, beans, bananas, millet, and Kafir corn. They do, however, also consume insects such as ants or lacoste and some freshwater fish. Despite their more vegetarian diet, their dental arches are superb. However, their rate of tooth decay with 5.5% in a study of 1041 teeth is slightly higher than the Masai. Also, Prices describe the Kikuyus as physically less rugged and less tall than the Masai. Their rate of dental irregularities was slightly higher at 18.2%.

Maragoli tribe, Kenya: The natives from this tribe live near Lake Victoria [2] that gives them access to large quantities of fish. Apart from fish, sweet potatoes and cereals were essential parts of their diet. The individuals are described as very strong and physically well developed with meager rates of dental caries of only 0,2%.

Muhima Tribe or Angola, Uganda: The people of the Muhima Tribe live similarly to the Masai, with milk, blood, and meat from their cattle constituting the main diet items. The individuals are described as tall and courageous, and out of their 1040 teeth studies, Price found not a single one with dental caries. 

Several of the tribes neighboring Ethiopia are agriculturists similar to the Kikuyu, with their diets consisting of corn, beans, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, Kafir corn, and other grains. Price argues that they are generally not as physically well built as their rival tribes using liberally dairy products or freshwater fish and are therefore often dominated by them. Yet, they are still in very healthy condition compared to tribes members that adopted European food, after which degenerative diseases got rampant.

Pygmies, Ituri Forest, Belgian Congo [3]: The natives living here are interesting because they originally lived in the trees and were exceedingly shy and difficult to contact. Taken to some of their villages by mission workers that they trust, Price and his wife managed to get in contact with them. Out of 352 teeth studied from twelve individuals, tooth decay had attacked eight teeth or 2.2%. Fish from numerous lakes and rivers were essential for their diets, often dried in the sun. It was also fascinating that these people valued certain insects such as flies, ants, and insect eggs, locusts in particular seasons, eaten fresh or dried.  

Baitu Tribe, Nyunge, Rwanda: The people of this tribe were described as exceptionally primitive as they only got discovered recently in 1894. The group lives mainly on dairy products from cattle and goats, sweet potatoes, cereals, and bananas. Price did not find a single tooth attacked out of 364 teeth studied.

Tribes of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan: Many tribes live here along the waterway of the Nile. Price describes them as wonderful hunters and warriors, with some of them being particularly tall. The area also provides excellent pasture for grazing cattle. These tribes, therefore, use milk, blood, and meat, and large quantities of animal life from the Nile river. Their immunity to dental caries approximated 100%. Price learned that they had a belief that every man and woman has a soul which resides in the liver and that character and physical growth depend upon how well he feeds that soul by eating the livers of animals. The liver is so sacred that human hands may not touch it. It is eaten both raw and cooked.

Terraizeka Tribe, Neurs Tribe, Dinkas Tribe: Those three tribes located in Sudan lived mainly on fish, dairy products, blood, or other animal life. Their immunity to dental caries was exceptional, ranging from 99.5% to 100%.

Modernized Africans: Price again studies Africans that have adopted a more modernized way of living as a control group. He did this by studying schools such as The Jeannes School, the Pygmy group, a hospital in Khartoum, and the Uganda mission, with various degrees of adoption of modern foods. There was a striking difference in the degree of facial deformities compared to native tribes ranging from 30-70%. (For the natives, all of them were below 20%) The rate of dental caries was also increased, but not as strong as seen in other regions averaging around 10%, whereas, for the primitive tribes, the rates range from 0% - 5%.

The native Arabs in several districts use camels' milk extensively, which Price describes as exceptionally nutritious. Nomads would sometimes live only on camels' milk for weeks. The primitive Arabs studied had delicate dental arches with minimal deformity. However, this health is rapidly lost when modernized foods are introduced, as found with individuals studies in Cairo, with rates of tooth decay increasing to 12.1% in 2092 teeth studies and the rate of deformities at 16.5%.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Australian Aborigines</h2>

<div>
Prices set out to study the Aborigines in eastern Australia, studying them both in their primitive conditions and modernized life as a control group. Price praised the Aborigines for their excellent knowledge about animals and hunting skills, especially tracking and fishing. Every boy and girl of these tribes must pass many examinations, such as hunting small animals and insects. There are three supreme tests of manhood. The first one is about withstanding hunger without complaint. For that, the boy has to participate in a march for two or three days over the hot desert, assist in preparing the meals of roast kangaroo and other choice foods without eating any himself. He must not complain. The second test is about fear in which he is placed under the most trying ordeals without knowing that it is part of the examination, and he must demonstrate that he will accept death rather than flee. Not following the social rules of the groups has immediate consequences. If a member of the group has defied the group's ideals, he is no longer allowed to live with them. The younger members are not allowed to kill older animals, for those the elders must be called which are permitted to do so. A council arranges marriages. Their religion is built around the stars, particularly the sun. 
The third and final examination of manhood is about withstanding pain. It consists of the boy lying on his back and allowing an appointed operator to knock out one of his front upper teeth. Modern food health and physical excellence were declining rapidly for the Aborigines placed into reservations used as laborers and feed. Facial deformities, such as narrowing and lengthening of the face and crooked tooth, were present in the next generation after adopting modern foods. Dental caries attacked 47,5% of men and 81.3% of women in a reservation near Sydney, and 40% percent of individuals had abnormal dental arches. The picture in a reservation in Cape Bedford was similar. The individuals there were working on plantations, and the mission and government entirely provided nutrition. The rate of tooth decay was 12.4% of their 2176 teeth, and the facial deformity rate was 46% in adults and 41.6% in children. Many deaths in the reservation were due to tuberculosis.
Price's next stop was at Lockhart River, to which he traveled via airplane, where he was able to study a group of primitively living Aborigines. This part of Australia, namely the York Peninsula, is still very primitive with no roads and the country being a primitive wilderness. Of the 1784 teeth examined, 4.3% were attacked by dental caries, where the majority was distributed among the adult man who worked on cattle ranches for the white man. Of the group, 6.3% had abnormal dental arches. 
Of the groups studied, some were from interior districts of Australia, and some had always lived near the coast. These two types of districts provided quite types of foods. Those near the coast used animal life from the sea, including fish, dugong or sea cow, a great variety of shellfish, and some sea plants as their primary diet items. The groups on the land depended on animal life of the land, which they ate with plant foods in each case. Foods available for these people are exceedingly limited in variety and quantity due to the absence of rains and the infertility of the soil. Plant foods consisted of roots, stems, leaves, berries, seeds of grasses, and a native pea eaten with tissues of large and small animals. The large animals hunted are the kangaroo and wallabies. Among the small animals are various rodents, insects, beetles, grubs, animal life from the rivers, and birds with their eggs. 
Another group living further inland was studied that lived on a reservation. Of 1236 teeth, 42.5% had been attacked with dental caries. While the adults showed 11.7% of deformed dental arches for the children, this has already progressed to 50%. Price witnessed several cases of tuberculosis and other illnesses in this group.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized Torres Strait Islanders</h2>

<div>
The Torres Strait Islands [1] are located in the north of Australia. Price planned to study primitive inhabitants descended from the Asiatic and Malay stocks in a tropical environment like the Papuans, New Guineans, Mobuiags, Arakuns, Kendals, and Yonkas. Recently, the Australian government installed stores on many islands providing modern clothing and foods such as white flour, polished rice, canned goods, and sugar.

The first island studied was Badu Island, in which the store had existed already for 23 years. Of the 586 teeth examined, 20.6% had been attacked by tooth decay; that is, 95% of individuals had dental caries. 33.3% of children had abnormal dental arches, whereas only 9.1% of adults' arches were abnormally formed, clearly showing the impact on the first generation after adopting modern foods.

Price found a similar picture on York Island [3], 12.7% of teeth were attacked by tooth decay, and almost half of the children showed abnormal dental arches. The island had been in contact with the pearl fishery industry for several years, with several men working on the fishing boats.

On Darnley Island, the store had been established more recently than on Badu Island. Here only 5.7% of teeth had been attacked by dental caries, and 29.6% of children had deformed arches (14.3% for the adults).
On Murray Island, only 0.7% of teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. Immunity to dental caries was nearly 100%. However, we still see 34.4% of abnormal dental arches. The governmental store was only established recently, and the natives here were very conscious of the imported foods with almost bloody opposition against the governmental program (14.3% in adults). Fish very extremely abundant on these islands, which attract many sharks that the islanders hunted.

On Hammond Island, people had access to a store on the neighboring Thursday Island. On this island, Price was able to examine a family that was still living entirely on foods produced by themselves that included bananas, pumpkins, and pawpaws, and animal foods from the sea. All of the children had usually developed dental arches. Of the 85 teeth examined, only 7.1% were attacked compared to 16.5% of the whole island population.

In general, Price describes the population on the Torres Islands as happy and content people with nearly perfect bodies with personalities and characters of a high degree of excellence. The islanders' primary food sources were tropical plants such as taro, bananas, papaya, plums, and seafood, including large and small fish in great abundance, dugong, and a great variety of shellfish. Whenever the natives adopted the white man's food, they suffer typical expressions of degeneration, such as loss of immunity to dental caries, marked facial and dental arch changes, and generally lower disease resistance. Diseases were much much rarer in the native islanders compared to the white population, as Price has learned from government physicians in charge of the supervision of the group.

<h2>Isolated and Modernized New Zealand Maori</h2>

<div>
Price's interest in studying Maori came from a study [1] done by Henry Percy Pickerill. Pickerill investigated skulls of the New Zealand Maori and found a meager rate of only two skulls out of 250 with carious teeth. That is 0.76% of skulls or 0.05% per tooth. Compared to the 95% rate of affected Maori living under modern civilizations, this is similar to Price's discovery throughout his journeys. Additionally, the skulls were formed normally in practically all of the skulls studied.

Price travels through New Zealand started in Wellington and went all the way north to Ahipara. He studied children in schools under modernized conditions and found 31-50% of individuals affected by dental caries and an incidence of dental arch deformity of 40-100%. In the older generations of many districts, he found 100% normally formed dental arches, while many of the children of those people again had a much higher rate of deformity. In the most isolated group studied, only 2% of teeth had been attacked by caries.
Particularly striking was the investigation of 40 Maori living under modernized conditions in a Tuberculosis hospital in Hawke's Bay (Interestingly, this hospital has been transformed into a vineyard in the meantime [2]). Modernization was demonstrated by the high rate of tooth decay and a 90% rate of dental arch abnormality in adults and 100% in children.
In Mahia Peninsula [3], Price studied some more isolated groups, mainly living off seafood. The individuals there had low rates of facial deformities, and caries attacked only 1.7% of teeth.
The primitive Maori used large quantities of foods from the sea, wherever these were available. Great emphasis was placed upon shell fish such as sea clamps. Mutton birds also were a primary diet item due to their large availability. Fern root was used in large qunatities.

<h2>Isoalted and Modernized Peruvian Indians</h2>

<div>
In Peru, Price again repeated his experiment in a new environment with high altitudes and freezing nights. Those studies were done in northern Cordillera, the western and eastern Andean range, and Chiclayo. The native people there utilized a wide variety of animal life from the sea in conjunction with the excellent plant foods grown close to the rivers. Many of the most commonly used modern plant foods have their origin in ancient Peru. The land animal foods were limited mainly to the llama, alpaca, and wild animals such as deer or birds. Each household, however, maintained a colony of guinea pigs. Meat and cereals were roasted. Their vegetable foods were potatoes, which were preserved in powder form by freezing, drying, and pulverizing, corn, varieties of beans, and quinoa. Dairy products were not a large part of the nutritional program, which is in striking contrast to the natives examined in the high valleys of Switzerland seen in the first chapter.
The teeth of the natives studied in Peru often were worn down quite heavily from eating rough foods, yet they remain resistant to tooth decay and very well-formed. People living in more modernized environments, such as Chiclayo, which had a railroad connection, lost immunity to dental caries, dental arches degenerated, disease resistance was lower, and people's character changed. In the high mountains of the Sacred Valley, Price examined a group of Indians that still lived in very native conditions. Caries had attacked not one tooth in this group. No dental deformities were found. Price examined another tribe living close to the Amazon river in still very primitive conditions with very simple shelter consisting of a framework covered with banana and palm leaves. Again not a single person was suffering from tooth decay. The native foods of these Amazon Jungle Indians included liberal use of freshwater fish, animal life from the forest, birdlife, including waterfowl, and their eggs, plants, and fruits. They use vast quantities of yucca, which is a starchy root quite similar to the potato.
Price also managed to study members of the same tribe living in modernized environments. The native foods were displaced by the usual refined flour products, sugar, sweetened foods, canned goods, and polished rice. The same degenerative effects as described in other cases were observed.
Price was particularly interested in ancient Peruvians and was able to study a large set of skulls provided by a museum. In a study of 1276 skulls of ancient Peruvians, he did not find a single head with significant deformity of the dental arches.
Many of the Andean Indians were found to chew cocoa leaves, those from which cocaine is produced. They chewed them together with the ashes received from burning a particular plant. Through an interpreter, Price was told that they could increase the quantity of the drug to make someone unconscious of pain and to be able to endure operations without discomfort. Apart from satisfaction, they say doing this will increase their endurance capacity and make them unconscious of hunger and fatigue.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>Micronutrients and Health</h3>

<div>
Price's main argument in the later sections is that a liberal supply of essential nutrients is necessary for good health and proper physical development. He cites experimental studies in which deficiency of one of the essential nutrients leads to congenital disabilities. For instance, the offspring of pigs that were depleted from Vitamin A was born blind. 
He shares some data about the food samples collected during his journey, which clearly shows several-fold increases in all of the at the time known micronutrients compared to double the specified minimum required amounts in those nutrients as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.
He also showed experimentally that supplementing with weekly doses of cod liver oil (oil extracted from livers of codfish that is exceptionally high in vitamin A, D, and other micronutrients) and vitamin A-rich butter helped reduce dietary caries in children.
Now fast forward to our modern times, we have more ways of explaining Price's results. 
Sugar and dental caries: The link between sugars and dental caries is now well established, as bacteria responsible for caries feed on sugars. However, while dietary sugars are a determinant of caries risk, they are not the only factor in the progression of the disease.  Other factors that can be influenced by nutrition are relevant to how well your teeth can repair from the mineral breakdown induced by the bacteria. [1]
Epigenetics: Nutriepigenomics is a very new field that only really established itself in the 21st century. This field of research is about how nutrient imbalances can affect gene expression [2] [3] [4]. One can find an interesting example of this reality in the animal world: If a bee turns into a worker or queen bee is purely determined by nutrition. Feeding with the so-called royal jelly triggers epigenetic reactions developing the specific features seen in the queen bee. Similarly, in humans, if genes are missing the appropriate nutrients to express themselves correctly, development is distorted. This could explain the mechanisms behind the dental arch deformities observed by Price in the first generations after adopting modern foods or the relatively higher difficulties arising during parturition.

</div>

<h3>Nutrition during pregnancy and growing ages</h3>
<div>
    It is interesting to see how all of the native tribes took special care to provide plenty of nutrition to the woman during pregnancy and lactation times and to the growing children. Diet items like organ meats, bone marrow, dried fish eggs, or unique crabs were reserved primarily for this group. It is, of course, perfectly sensible that providing nutrient-dense food sources to children and their mothers would enable the child's optimal development. In our modern society, we don't see as much emphasis on this topic, apart from the usually prescribed multivitamin pills for the becoming mothers.
</div>
<h3>The many ways of eating healthy</h3>
<div>
    The studies done by Price demonstrate that there are many different ways of eating a healthy diet. Modern dietary recommendations mainly advocate the liberal use of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for good health. However, as we have seen, some natives like the Inuit, the natives Americans, or the cattle tribes in Africa managed to achieve excellent health while only using very little of those foods. Some of their diets would even be considered unhealthy by some nutritionists due to their high saturated fats and red meat content, and lack of plant foods. Instead, Prices' studies demonstrate that we should be wary of unhealthy foods from the modernized world: white flour products, sugary foods, white rice, canned goods, or vegetable fats. Often highly processed or refined to achieve higher shelf lives and lower production costs.
</div>
<h3>The forgotten health food - Organ meats</h3>
<div>
    As we have seen, many native people valued organ meats highly. In some of the African tribes, the livers were even subject to religious worship. In comparison, those foods are not valued a lot in our modern society, especially not as a healthy food choice. They are sold much cheaper than muscle meats and are regularly fed to pets because we think they are nasty to eat. Looking, however, at the micronutrient content of these foods, we immediately learn why the natives valued them so highly. They are loaded with vitamins and minerals. Foods thought of as being healthy, as Broccoli or Apples look like a joke in comparison. (And this is not even taking essential fats or amino acids into account, which are also found abundantly) Especially they are providing precisely those nutrients that are commonly missing in plant foods in exceptionally high quantities.
