  <p>In this short article, I would like to share my personal experiences with psychosomatic complaints. I will talk about the insights I have gained over time, and what resources were helpful.
  </p>
  <p>In my life, there have been recurring instances when I experienced physical symptoms for which I could not obtain a clear medical explanation, even after repeated medical check-ups. The symptoms range from back pain, dental and jaw problems, pelvis discomfort, ear pain, and much more. Some of the symptoms were particularly strange, such as a constant feeling of heat in one of my calves, as if I were standing next to a radiator.
  </p>
  <p>Over time, I have grappled with these issues and eventually came to the realization that these are psychosomatic complaints, meaning issues caused by psychological rather than physical reasons.
    This first "aha moment" was already helpful, as the symptoms thereby lost some of their power, it gave me some explanation and reassurance that physically everything is okay with me, and I no longer felt compelled to visit doctors as the only way to solve my complaints.
  </p>

  <h2>What causes psychosomatic symptoms?</h2>

  <p>
    A book by Dr. John Sarno, which narrated a series of patients whose chronic back pain also had no physical causes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/144873">[1]</a>, was particularly helpful to me. I could identify with that. At the time, I regularly had brief episodes of temporary, severe back pain. The author's theory was that repressed emotions could be the cause of such complaints (specifically by certain unconscious suppression of blood flow to areas of the body). The solution is to divert attention from the back to the psychological level and try to find possible psychological causes.<br/>
    I was very convinced of this theory and I think this belief helped me, so that I was actually relatively quickly relieved of my complaints. I was also able to reflect on what was happening in my life at the time, what was causing stress, and what might have initially triggered the complaints. Especially important, I think, was to divert attention away from the problem area and to lose the fear of recurring episodes or that something might be wrong with my back.

  <h2>Myofascial trigger points</h2>

  <p>
    Another "aha moment" was when I learned about muscle trigger points. Trigger points are small, spasm-like conditions in the muscle fibers that can transmit pain and discomfort to other parts of the body via connective tissue. That is, the cause of the pain can be in a muscle that is sometimes far awawy from the point of pain <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18054148/#:~:text=A%20myofascial%20trigger%20point%20is,motor%20dysfunction%2C%20and%20autonomic%20phenomena.">[2]</a>. <br/>
    Trigger points can have many causes, such as poor posture, overuse, muscle tension, or psychological causes such as stress or emotions. The theory was first written in 1942 by a woman named Dr. Janet Travell, even though there are historical overlaps, for example with acupuncture. It wasn't until the early 2000s that the theories were first scientifically proven when trigger points could be made visible for the first time using ultrasound and MRI <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myofascial-Pain-Dysfunction-Trigger-Manual/dp/0683083635">[3]</a>. <br/>
    I first became aware of the subject when I had a so-called prostatitis, an inflammation in the prostate, for which no bacterial or other cause could be found. I stumbled upon a study <a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1097/01.ju.0000161609.31185.d5">[4]</a> in which patients with similar complaints were treated with trigger point massage and in 70% of cases, symptoms had improved, which gave me hope.<br/>
    I then read the book "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook" <a href="https://triggerpointbook.com/">[5]</a>, which was somewhat easier to read than the original studies. The book explained which trigger points could be responsible for various complaints, and also how to treat them yourself through massage. Many of the other complaints mentioned in the book, I had also experienced, such as the back pain mentioned earlier, so I not only had an explanation for my then current complaints, but also potentially other psychosomatic problems I had experienced in the past. <br/>
    Trigger points can be treated with simple massage, by pressing the points several times, thereby stimulating blood flow and thus helping to dissolve the trigger points over time. With the help of this technique and additional stretching exercises that I found on YouTube, I was able to get my prostatitis under control.

  <h2>History of psychosomatic problems and conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The role of thoughts, mental well-being, optimism, and self-confidence in connection with physical complaints is not necessarily a new insight. Pierre Janet's studies on the treatment of psychological illnesses in the 19th and early 20th centuries recorded numerous such cases <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychological-Healing-Historical-Clinical-Study/dp/1684224071">[6]</a>. Back then, these complaints were seen as symptoms of hysteria, a term used at the time for a variety of mental and nervous diseases.<br/>
    Treatments, such as those from Mary Eddy or Paul Dubois, aim to trace patients' complaints back to a misguided mental attitude. Mary Eddy's "Mind over Body" approach was so extreme that a kind of sect formed around her, which still exists today <a href="https://www.christianscience.com/">[7]</a>. Freud saw subconscious conflicts as the cause of psychosomatic complaints <a href="https://archive.org/details/studiesinhysteri00sigm">[8]</a>. Even in the 17th century, some doctors recognized and recorded the essential influence of the mind on the body <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/mannigfaltigen-Einflu%C3%9F-Gem%C3%BCtsbewegungen-menschlichen-K%C3%B6rper-Halle1695/31386057122/bd">[9]</a>.
    Even though these early attempts at treatment may seem curious, they helped me understand certain facts. Specifically, I became more aware of the influence our thoughts can have on our physical well-being. Specifically, negative thoughts can lead to the continuation of psychosomatic complaints, even if the initial cause may already be in the past. The fear that something is physically wrong with me and excessive attention to the problem area, leads to further tension, and the complaints persist. Optimism and trust, on the other hand, provide a certain security, which can positively affect and eliminate the problems.

    In conclusion, it is worth noting that there are many other ways our psyche can affect our bodies. For example, chronic stress can lead to permanently elevated cortisol levels, which can cause trouble on its own and in turn affect insulin levels and ultimately lead to heart disease or diabetes. The gut-brain axis, which directly connects parts of the brain and gut via nerve pathways, also seems relevant. I was also impressed by experiments during the heyday of hypnotherapy, where therapists were reportedly able to induce skin rashes in hypnotized patients through suggestion <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psychological-Healing-Historical-Clinical-Study/dp/1684224071">[6]</a>.<br/>
    I was long skeptical of relaxation exercises and meditation, arguing that sleep should actually serve this purpose. Why not try to sleep better instead of meditating? However, I have since changed my opinion and am convinced of the effectiveness of exercises such as progressive muscle relaxation, belly breathing, yoga, and meditation, especially when it comes to reducing muscle tension, preventing trigger points, dealing with stress, and generally calming the organism. A book I can recommend on this subject is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41016873-full-catastrophe-living">[10]</a>.
    Good sleep, of course, also has its importance. Sleep, healthy nutrition, exercise, sunshine, and social bonds should, in my opinion, generally be considered as the building blocks of a healthy lifestyle. <br/>
    Finally it is important to acknowledge that much remains to be understood about psychosomatic illness, which ultimately makes it a very interesting topic of research.
